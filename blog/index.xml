      <description>This isn&amp;rsquo;t even meant directly for you. Really anybody who wants to, can read it. I&amp;rsquo;ll post it.
Whenever I sleep, there&amp;rsquo;s a disconnect of consciousness. That is, that version of my consciousness dies in some definition and a new version wakes up. This is literally true, because I know for a fact my brain undergoes changes while I&amp;rsquo;m sleeping. So I die every night I sleep and a new version takes my place.</description>

      <description>An interesting notion came to me. In the shower, I was musing about my lack of ideas for topics to write about. I briefly explored the possibility that I simply don&amp;rsquo;t have that many interesting thoughts. Maybe just forcing myself to write stuff out just made that obvious, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s as simple as that. I can talk peoples&amp;rsquo; ears off in real life.
It&amp;rsquo;s simple; I just expect you to know everything I already do.</description>
