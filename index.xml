      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been analyzing what I like. Why I like certain things, etc.
There&amp;rsquo;s the obvious ones: Video games and poker. That&amp;rsquo;s simple, because I like winning. Some others are more social or romantic, fulfilling basic human needs involving other humans.
There&amp;rsquo;s one that&amp;rsquo;s odd that I haven&amp;rsquo;t quite found the answer to. And that&amp;rsquo;s art. Why do I enjoy a good movie or a book? There&amp;rsquo;s a fair argument to be made that I empathize with the characters, as in put myself into their shoes.</description>

      <description>An interesting notion came to me. In the shower, I was musing about my lack of ideas for topics to write about. I briefly explored the possibility that I simply don&amp;rsquo;t have that many interesting thoughts. Maybe just forcing myself to write stuff out just made that obvious, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s as simple as that. I can talk peoples&amp;rsquo; ears off in real life.
It&amp;rsquo;s simple; I just expect you to know everything I already do.</description>

      <description>About me I haven&amp;rsquo;t decided how much I want to reveal yet. Probably not that much.</description>
