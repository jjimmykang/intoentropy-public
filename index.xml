      <description>An interesting notion came to me. In the shower, I was musing about my lack of ideas for topics to write about. I briefly explored the possibility that I simply don&amp;rsquo;t have that many interesting thoughts. Maybe just forcing myself to write stuff out just made that obvious, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s as simple as that. I can talk peoples&amp;rsquo; ears off in real life.
It&amp;rsquo;s simple; I just expect you to know everything I already do.</description>
