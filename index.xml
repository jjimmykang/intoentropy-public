      <description>My college physical life was a bit strange. I worked out(weights) nearly every day, except that I basically didn&amp;rsquo;t move from my chair at any other point in time. Food was a block away, and I nearly never went to class. The few times I did, I would use an electric scooter. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t like I was a health nut, but I generally kept my weight between 175-180lb as a 6&#39;0 male.</description>

      <description>I think my base nature is to not be appreciative of the things I truly have. Every day, I think about the things that I could be doing. I could be slaving away at an art school, working to perfect my craft to create my masterpiece someday. I could be doing a PhD, serving my years to be part of the AI revolution that&amp;rsquo;s hopefully coming. I could be a writer, searching for some type of meaning that I could impart on my readers.</description>
